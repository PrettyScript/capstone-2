* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
In a series of modules, we have learned the concepts of OOP, as well as the fundamentals, 
and we even touched on advanced concepts of Java. Our biggest priority is to apply the knowledge 
that we have gained to create a terminal game in Java. If we are confident and have managed our 
time well, we can add bonus functionality such as adhering to SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design, 
adding a 3rd party Java library, or use React to showcase the functionality of the game.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
In my first capstone, I didn't draw/use a diagram to plan out my project. I plan to utilize a UML diagram (Creately) 
to have a high-level vision of the classes/components to create my game. Also, I found that when I used a to-do list 
it was easy to keep track of the status of my completion and made it easy to manage my time.
