Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  
The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

Connect Four

To begin the game, you would press the run button on the terminal and follow the instructions
to begin the game. You will be asked your name, and the second player's name. Each player will be
prompted to provide the column where they would like to play their chip. The objective of the game is to be
the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's chips. In rare case, 
there is a chance no one wins the game, in that case, it would be called a Cat game.
